# The Problem

- Write a grading program for a class with the following grading policies:
  - There are three quizzes, each graded on the basis of 10 points.
  - There is 1 midterm exam, graded on the basis of 100 points.
  - There is 1 final exam, grade on the basis of 100 points.
- The final exam counts for 40% of the grade, midterm counts for 35% of the grade and the 3 quizzes together account for 25%. Use the standard grading scale. The program should read in the student’s scores and output the student’s record which consist of three quiz scores and two exam scores, as well as the student’s overall numeric score for the course and the final letter grade.

- Define a class for the student record. The class should have instance variables for the quizzes, midterm, and final. The overall numeric score is a number in the range 0 to 100, which represents the weighted average of the student’s work. The class should have methods to compute the overall numeric grade. Your class should have a reasonable set of setters and getters, an Equals method and a ToString method. Create a value constructor. You may also add other methods as you see fit.
