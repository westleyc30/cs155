/// Write a Temperature class that has two instance variables: a temperature
/// value (a floating-point number) and a character for the scale, either C for
/// Celsius of F for Fahrenheit.  The class should have 4 constructor methods:
/// one for each instance variable (assume zero degress if no value is specified
/// and Celsius if no scale is specified), one with two parameters for the two
/// instance variables, and a no-argument constructor (set to zero degrees
/// Celsius).  Include the following:

///Two getter methods to return the temperature, 1 of them to return the
///temperature in Celsius, the other to return the temperature in Fahrenheit.
///Return the value rounded to the nearest tenth of a degree.
///
///Three setter methods, one to set the temperature, one to set the scale and
///one to set both instance variables.
///
///A suitable ToString method.
///
///An Equals method that compares two temperatures. Hint call the same
///getTemperature method and compare that.
///
///A driver program that tests each of the constructors, each of the getters,
///each of the setter, the ToString method and the equals method, make sure
///that the Equals can return both true and false.
